12.8 Flight Performance 835
E X A M P L E 1 2 . 4
A liquid propellant rocket uses hydrogen fuel and oxygen
for combustion. The oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio is 4.02. The
ratio of specic heats of the combustion gas is=1.26 andthe chamber pressure is 1000 psia. Use Equation 12.18 to
estimate combustion gas constantRas well as the molecu-
lar weight of the mixture, MW.
SOLUTION
From Table 12.1, we readTc=2999 K andc∗=2432 m/s
corresponding to the liquid propellant described above....
