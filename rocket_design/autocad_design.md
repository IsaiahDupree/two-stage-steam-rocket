# AutoCAD Design of Two-Stage Space Vehicle

## Overview
This section presents detailed 2D and 3D drawings of our conceptual two-stage space vehicle design, with comprehensive component layouts, stage separation mechanisms, and structural outlines.

## Vehicle Configuration
The two-stage rocket design incorporates a larger first stage for initial lift-off thrust and a smaller, more efficient second stage optimized for vacuum performance. Key features include:

- **Overall Length**: 12.4 meters
- **Maximum Diameter**: 1.2 meters (first stage)
- **Gross Lift-off Weight**: 840 kg
- **Payload Capacity**: 15 kg

## First Stage Specifications
The first stage provides the initial thrust needed to overcome Earth's gravity and accelerate the vehicle:

- **Length**: 7.2 meters
- **Diameter**: 1.2 meters
- **Propellant**: High-pressure steam (water)
- **Dry Mass**: 220 kg
- **Propellant Mass**: 460 kg
- **Total Mass**: 680 kg
- **Engine**: Single steam pressure vessel with optimized sea-level nozzle
- **Structure**: Stainless steel 304 pressure vessel with aluminum frame

## Second Stage Specifications
The second stage activates after first stage separation to provide efficient propulsion in near-vacuum conditions:

- **Length**: 5.2 meters
- **Diameter**: 0.8 meters
- **Propellant**: High-pressure steam (water)
- **Dry Mass**: 80 kg
- **Propellant Mass**: 65 kg
- **Total Mass**: 145 kg
- **Engine**: Single steam pressure vessel with vacuum-optimized nozzle
- **Structure**: Titanium alloy pressure vessel with composite overwrap

## Stage Separation System
The interstage connector uses a mechanically simple yet reliable separation system:

- **Mechanism**: Circumferential explosive bolts with spring-loaded pushers
- **Electronics**: Redundant triggering system with multiple confirmation sensors
- **Safety**: Mechanical interlocks to prevent premature separation
- **Post-separation stability**: Small cold-gas thrusters for attitude control

## Structural Analysis
The structure is designed to withstand the following loads:

- **Maximum Axial Acceleration**: 5g
- **Maximum Lateral Loading**: 1.5g
- **Acoustic Loading**: 145 dB
- **Vibration Spectrum**: 20-2000 Hz

## CAD Drawings
The detailed CAD drawings include:

1. **Full Assembly**: Complete two-stage vehicle with all major components
2. **Structural Frame**: Primary load-bearing members and attachment points
3. **Pressure Vessels**: First and second stage propellant tanks
4. **Nozzle Designs**: Both sea-level and vacuum-optimized nozzles
5. **Separation System**: Detailed view of the interstage connector
6. **Payload Bay**: Accommodation for various payload configurations

## Materials Selection
Materials were selected based on their specific properties and application requirements:

- **Pressure Vessels**: 
  - First Stage: Stainless Steel 304 (yield strength 215 MPa)
  - Second Stage: Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy (yield strength 880 MPa)
  
- **Structural Components**:
  - Primary Structure: 6061-T6 aluminum (lightweight, good strength-to-weight ratio)
  - High-Temperature Areas: Inconel 718 (heat resistance)
  
- **Nozzles**:
  - Throat: Copper alloy (thermal conductivity)
  - Expansion Section: Stainless steel with thermal barrier coating

## Design Considerations
The design incorporates several key considerations for manufacturability and operability:

1. **Modular Assembly**: Components designed for ease of manufacturing and assembly
2. **Maintenance Access**: Strategic access panels for critical components
3. **Transport Considerations**: Vehicle sections designed to fit standard transportation containers
4. **Field Assembly**: Minimal tools required for final assembly at launch site
5. **Environmental Protection**: Corrosion-resistant materials and protective coatings
