# Drone Nose Cone Technical Specifications

## Dimensional Requirements

### Base Specifications
- Inside diameter: 67 mm
- Outside diameter: 78 mm
- Wall thickness at base: 5.5 mm ((78-67)/2)
- Base ring depth: 13 mm
- Base ring diameter: 67 mm (to fit inside fuselage)

### Geometry
- Cone angle: 52 degrees from base
- Tip style: Rounded (not pointed)

## Material Considerations
- Design for 3D printing
- Prioritize lightweight structure
- Consider infill patterns that maintain shape while minimizing material
- No specific strength requirements

## Design Approach

### Suggested Modeling Steps
1. Create a base ring cylinder: 67 mm diameter, 13 mm height
2. Create the outer cone with 52-degree angle from base
3. Create inner cone (hollow portion)
4. Round the tip with appropriate fillet
5. Add lightweight structural elements if needed (e.g., internal ribs)

### Optimization Considerations
- Wall thickness can gradually decrease toward the tip
- Internal support structures can be used to maintain shape with minimal material
- Air vents may be necessary for proper 3D printing

## File Format Requirements
- Primary: STL or OBJ for 3D printing
- Source file in appropriate CAD format (e.g., STEP, Fusion 360, SolidWorks, etc.)

## Additional Notes
- Consider printing orientation to minimize support material
- Test prints at smaller scale may be helpful before final production
