Profile Recommendations:
=======================
1. For minimum drag at supersonic speeds: Von Kármán
2. For minimum drag at subsonic/transonic speeds: Tangent Ogive
3. For ease of manufacturing: Conical
4. For balanced performance: Elliptical
5. For optimized volume-to-drag ratio: Ogive

Note: The optimal profile depends on the specific application and flight regime.
For lightweight drone applications, the elliptical or ogive profiles often provide
a good balance between aerodynamic performance and ease of manufacturing.
