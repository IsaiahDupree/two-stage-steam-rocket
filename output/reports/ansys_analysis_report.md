# Rocket Design - Ansys Analysis Setup Report

> **Note:** This report was generated in simulation mode because Ansys Geometry Core is not available. It represents what would be done in Ansys but no actual Ansys operations were performed.

## Model Components

The following components were created for Ansys Geometry:

- **first_stage**: FirstStage (cylinder)
- **second_stage**: SecondStage (cylinder)
- **nose_cone**: NoseCone (cone)
- **nozzle**: Nozzle (cone)

## Analysis Types

### Fluid Dynamics Analysis

- **Analysis Type**: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- **Target Software**: Ansys Fluent
- **Physics Models**: External Aerodynamics, Compressible Flow
- **Expected Outputs**: Pressure distribution, drag coefficient, velocity field

### Structural Analysis

- **Analysis Type**: Static Structural
- **Target Software**: Ansys Mechanical
- **Physics Models**: Linear Elasticity
- **Expected Outputs**: Stress distribution, deformation, factor of safety

## Export Locations

- Fluent Analysis Files: `C:\Users\Isaia\OneDrive\Documents\Coding\RocketDesign\rocket_design\output\ansys_test\rocket_flow_volume.step`
- Mechanical Analysis Files: `C:\Users\Isaia\OneDrive\Documents\Coding\RocketDesign\rocket_design\output\ansys_test\rocket_mechanical.step`

## Next Steps

1. Open the exported files in the respective Ansys applications
2. Define boundary conditions and simulation parameters
3. Run the simulations
4. Analyze results and iterate on the design as needed

## Using This Report With Ansys

Since this report was generated in simulation mode, you'll need to:

1. Create the rocket geometry directly in Ansys SpaceClaim or import from FreeCAD
2. Follow the analysis setup guidelines outlined above
3. Manually set up the fluid and structural analyses

To use the full Ansys integration functionality, install the required PyAnsys packages:

```
pip install ansys-geometry-core
```
